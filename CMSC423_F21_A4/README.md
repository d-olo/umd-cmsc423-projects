This program is written in Java.

The hardest part was keeping in mind which string I made the column and which one I made the row, which made it harder for me to refer to certain parts of the matrix.

I consulted https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computational_Biology/Book%3A_Computational_Biology_-_Genomes_Networks_and_Evolution_(Kellis_et_al.)/03%3A_Rapid_Sequence_Alignment_and_Database_Search/3.03%3A_Global_alignment_vs._Local_alignment_vs._Semi-global_alignment and https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs466/sp2020/slides/Lecture5_WeightedSeqeunceAlignment.pdf for more examples of string alignment.
