# umd-cmsc423-projects
This repository contains the five projects I completed for the "Bioinformatic Algorithms, Databases, and Tools" course at the University of Maryland in the fall of 2021.
Each project is stored in a separate folder. The projects demonstrate several techniques used in the field of bioinformatics, as well as the big data manipulation necessary for storing and searching genomes.
